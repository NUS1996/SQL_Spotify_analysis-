# üéµ Spotify Data Analysis Project

This project focuses on performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and solving **business queries** using SQL on a simulated Spotify dataset. The dataset combines both Spotify and YouTube streaming metrics, offering a fun and comprehensive view of track performance, artist reach, and musical features.

## üí° Project Goals

- Clean and prepare the dataset for analysis.
- Extract insights to help **business decisions** like artist partnerships, marketing strategies, and content recommendations.
- Practice **SQL queries** including aggregations, window functions, CTEs, and conditional logic.

---

## üîç Exploratory Data Analysis

Key steps and queries:
- Counting total rows, distinct artists and albums.
- Analyzing album types and track duration statistics.
- Removing anomalies (tracks with 0-minute duration).
- Listing tracks with more than **1 billion streams**.
- Calculating total comments for licensed tracks.
- Counting tracks by artist and album types.
- Aggregating musical features with `AVG()`, `MIN()`, `MAX()` into views.
- Finding high-energy tracks and YouTube performance patterns.
- Identifying platform preferences (Spotify vs YouTube) using `HAVING` and `CTEs`.
- Using **window functions** to rank top tracks per artist.
- Investigating above-average liveness tracks.
- Calculating energy range per album.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used

- SQL (PostgreSQL dialect preferred)
- Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS)
- Window Functions, CTEs, and Views
- Git & GitHub for version control

---

## üìå How to Use

1. Clone the repository.
2. Import the SQL file to your local PostgreSQL or any compatible RDBMS.
3. Execute queries step by step to explore and analyze.
4. Use the insights to design dashboards, reports, or build predictive models.

## üìà Insights Highlights

- Identified top streamed tracks with over 1 billion plays.
- Measured musical properties across the entire catalog.
- Ranked top 3 most-viewed tracks for every artist.
- Discovered songs streamed more on Spotify than on YouTube.
- Calculated album-wise energy ranges to spot mood diversity.

---

## üí° Future Enhancements
